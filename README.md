# SpringBoard-Logistic-Regression
Mini project Machine Learning and Logistic Regression

## Background
In this project we'll use a dataset of heights and weights of males and females to hone our understanding of classifiers. We load the data into a dataframe and plot it.

## Resources
This data set is available in the sklearn python module which is how we will access it today.

## Conclusion
We use interpretation of sklearn logistic regression and cross-validation to create, train, and test a model. We then automate the process.
